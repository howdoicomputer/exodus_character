### About

This is a simple repository that I am using to track my journey into the Exodus table top RPG.

### Character

There is a `character.yml` file that contains a structure that represents my character sheet.

### TODO

* Able to convert the `yml` file into a `csv` so other people can look at my spreadsheet a bit better.
* Create small static web site that displays my charactert sheet.
* A small CLI that performs character sheet calculations.

### Exodus

Exodus is a table top that mirros the Fallout universe.
